# What will I learn?
   You'll learn how to manipulate large and realistic datasets with Spark to engineer relevant features for predicting churn. You'll learn how to use Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets, far beyond what could be done with non-distributed technologies like scikit-learn.

## Career Relevance

   - Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. 
   - Additionally, the ability to efficiently manipulate large datasets with Spark is one of the highest-demand skills in the field of data.

## Essential Skills

   - Load large datasets into Spark and manipulate them using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframes
   - Use the machine learning APIs within Spark ML to build and tune models
   - Integrate the skills you've learned in the Spark course and the Data Scientist Nanodegree program
